// Part 03, topic 2 — reading what the user types (Scanner)
//
// SECTION A — FOLLOW ALONG: type the code from the video (or the guide) in this file.
//    His class is called Main. Yours is called UserInput.
//    Leave the "package part03;" line and the "public class UserInput" line alone.
//    He types an import line ABOVE the class. Type yours on the empty line
//    under "package part03;".
//
// SECTION B — COMMENTS: when you finish, put a // comment ABOVE every line of code,
//    saying in YOUR OWN WORDS what that line does. That includes the import line.

public class UserInput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // asking the user what their name is and then waiting on their input in order to proceed
        System.out.println("What is your name?");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        // same as above waiting on the users input and it has to be an integer variable
        System.out.println("How old are you?");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine();
        //what is the fav food same as the 2 above as well just has to be string variables
        System.out.println("What is your favorite food?");
        String food = scanner.nextLine();
        // printts out all the user inputed values into the format shown below.
        System.out.println("Hello " + name);
        System.out.println("You are " + age + " years old");
        System.out.println("You like " + food);
