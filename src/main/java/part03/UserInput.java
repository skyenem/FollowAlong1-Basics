// Part 03, topic 2 — reading what the user types (Scanner)
//
// SECTION A — FOLLOW ALONG: type the code from the video (or the guide) in this file.
//    His class is called Main. Yours is called UserInput.
//    Leave the "package part03;" line and the "public class UserInput" line alone.
//    He types an import line ABOVE the class. Type yours on the empty line
//    under "package part03;".
//
// SECTION B — COMMENTS: when you finish, put a // comment ABOVE every line of code,
//    saying in YOUR OWN WORDS what that line does. That includes the import line.
