// SECTION A — FOLLOW ALONG: type the code from the video (or the guide) in this class.
//    His class is called Main. Yours is called RandomNumbers.
//    (Do NOT name it Random. Java already has a class called Random.)
//    Leave the "package part05;" line and the "public class RandomNumbers" line alone.
//    The import line goes BETWEEN them (the guide shows where).
//
// SECTION B — COMMENTS: when you finish, put a // comment ABOVE every line of code,
//    saying in YOUR OWN WORDS what that line does.

        // generating a random integer that is bound between 6 and 1 then because the pluss one basically moves where the starting value is frrom 0 to 1
        int x = rand.nextInt(6) + 1;
        System.out.println(x);
        // generates a random double number with no bound
